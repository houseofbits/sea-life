    "fact": "Using genetic sequencing, scientists discovered in 2018 that there are two flounder species that are similar in appearance but differ in their spawning behaviour. European flounder spawn at depth and have free-floating eggs, whereas Baltic flounder spawn in the shallows and deposit their eggs on the seabed."
