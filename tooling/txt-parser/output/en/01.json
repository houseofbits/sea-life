Its flanks, chest and neck are white, the back and tail are black, the wings are black and white.

            "content": "From northern and central Europe eastwards across Eurasia to Kamchatka. In North America, from Alaska to the Labrador Peninsula. It winters on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts, in most of southern Europe, the eastern Mediterranean basin, in the Black and Caspian Seas, and in Kazakhstan and eastern China. In North America it winters along the Pacific coast, south to the Gulf of California; inland it goes south of its breeding range all the way to Florida.The Goldeneye is a relatively common breeding, migrant and wintering species in Latvia. It breeds throughout the country near a variety of water bodies, even quite small ones. In the second half of summer, large flocks of molting Goldeneyes concentrate in various parts of the sea. When migrating they are frequently at sea, as well as inland in places. They winter along the seacoast and in unfrozen inland waters."
