The long-tailed duck is characterised by a wide variety of plumage patterns. The basic plumage colour in males is white with brown, grey and black patterns that depend on its age and the season. Long-tailed ducks are unique in that both males and females moult three times a year. Males are whiter during the breeding season and become darker as they moult. The face is usually white, the wings are dark with white shoulders, and the belly is white. Females are speckled brown, with a light-coloured head and belly."
