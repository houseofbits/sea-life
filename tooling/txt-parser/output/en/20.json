The gametes mature in conceptacles, special cavities in the tips of the algal fronds. Reproduction takes place on nights when there is a full or new moon."

            "title": "Uses",
            "content": "Iodine and other elements were once extracted from bladder wrack. It used to be fed to physically weak children to help them grow. Today Fucus species are used in cosmetics and food additives. People living along the coast harvest it and use it as a rich source of fertiliser. Bladder wrack that has washed ashore serves as good feeding grounds for wading birds due to the invertebrates, such as small crustaceans, that wash up along with it."

    ],
    "fact": "Bladder wrack meadows are an important habitat for many invertebrate species and an important spawning ground for fish. The meadows need light to grow, and are therefore threatened by reduction in water transparency due to eutrophication. Bladder wrack meadows die off after incidents in which petroleum products have been released into the water."
