Eelpouts usually reach sexual maturity in their second year of life, when they are 13 - 18 cm long. Mating takes place in July - September. The eggs develop in the female for several months until December - February, when 30 - 400 small eelpouts, 3 - 5 cm long, are born."

            "content": "The eelpout is an important fish for coastal fishermen. The largest catches are made in the Gulf of Riga during the summer months. Eelpouts are caught with specialised traps (fyke nets) as well as in fish traps for other kinds of fish."

    "fact": "The eelpout is often used as an environmental indicator because it is a viviparous fish and makes relatively short migrations, thus giving a good indication of the local state of the environment. The bones of the eelpout are greenish in colour."
