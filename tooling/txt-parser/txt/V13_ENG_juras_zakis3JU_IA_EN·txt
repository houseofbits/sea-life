Lumpfish 
Cyclopterus lumpus 
Order: Scorpaeniformes
Family: Cyclopteridae

External appearance
In the Baltic Sea the lumpfish grows to 20 cm in length. They are usually greyish-blue in colour, but during the breeding season the male's belly turns red, whereas the female's belly turns bluish-green. 

Distribution
The lumpfish is found in the North Atlantic. 

Diet
Its main food source is various crustaceans and worms. When it swims at heights above the seabed, the lumpfish feeds on jellyfish and small fish. 

Development
Spawning takes place in the winter and spring months close to the coast. Males arrive first and occupy the spawning area. Lumpfish form pairs during breeding. After spawning, the males guard the eggs. 

Fishing
Lungfish are fished in some countries. Their eggs are used to make caviar. 

Interesting facts
Lumpfish do not have a swimbladder. Their pelvic fins have fused, forming a suction cup which the fish uses to attach itself to rocky substrates.
