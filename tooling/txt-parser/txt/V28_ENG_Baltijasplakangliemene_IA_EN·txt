Baltic macoma 
Macoma balthica
Family: Tellinidae
Class: Bivalvia

External appearance
15 - 22 mm in size, the shell has a rounded triangular shape and is pink or yellowish in colour. The outer surface of the thin shell is smooth.

Distribution
The Baltic macoma inhabits the northern Atlantic Ocean and also parts of the Mediterranean. Masses of washed-up shells are very common on Latvia's Baltic Sea coastline, especially in the Gulf of Riga.

Ecology
Inhabits shallow waters. Young macoma live on aquatic plants; as they mature, they move to the sandy bottom. This species is used as an indicator in marine pollution assessments. The Baltic macoma is unable to live for long periods in areas with a thick layer of mud.

Interesting facts
A different but very similar-looking species, Macoma petalum, lives in North America.
