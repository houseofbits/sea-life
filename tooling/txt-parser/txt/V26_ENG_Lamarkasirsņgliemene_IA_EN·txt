Lagoon cockle 
Cerastoderma glaucum
Family: Cardiidae (cockles)
Class: Bivalvia

External appearance
A marine bivalve with a white to greyish-white shell. The outside of the shell is ribbed and has a serrated edge. The shell can grow up to 50 mm, but in Latvia they only grow to 20 mm because the Baltic Sea is not saline enough.

Distribution
The lagoon cockle inhabits the Baltic, Black, Caspian and Mediterranean Seas. The shells are often seen washed up on the Baltic coast, especially along the Gulf of Riga.

Ecology
Inhabits shallow waters. Young bivalves live on aquatic plants; as they mature, they move to the sandy bottom.

Interesting facts
Due to its high variability, the species has developed a large number of synonyms. In many places people use cockles as a source of food.
