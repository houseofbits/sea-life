Common seasnail 
Liparis liparis
Order: Scorpaeniformes
Family: Liparidae

External appearance
The body of the common seasnail appears slightly transparent and can reach a length of 27 cm, but in Latvian waters they usually only grow up to 15 cm.

Distribution
The common seasnail is distributed in the seas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. It is most common in areas with a hard seabed, where it can attach with sucking disc-shaped fins, but it can also be found along the coast on sandy or muddy substrates.

Diet
Eats crustaceans, especially opossum shrimps, and worms. May also feed on fish eggs. 

Development
The common seasnail spawns off the coast in winter, from November to February. The eggs are attached to algae or other seabed substrates. Their development lasts 6 - 8 weeks. 

Fishing
Due to its small size and relatively rare occurrence, the species is not important in commercial fishing or angling.

Interesting facts
The pelvic fins have fused together in the shape of a disk, making it easier to attach to the seabed.
